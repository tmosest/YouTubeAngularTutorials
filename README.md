##Video 0: What you will need and a basic introduction.

In this video you will download the things that you are going to need to get started,
and see a very basic example of the AngularJS Hello World app.

####Learning Objectives:
* Download Git.
* Download a text editor.
* See basic example of jQuery vs AngularJS.

###Download Git

To download git:

1) For windows users:

Simply google git and navigate to https://git-scm.com/ from there you will find a download for it. I highly recommend that you install it using the Git Bash Version to keep the linux commands separate from your windows commands.

2) For Mac users:

You can install the GUI version from https://git-scm.com/ however if you want to install the command line version which I recommend then you should google how to install brew and use it to install git instead.

Here is a good article on how to do this: https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/

###Download a text editor

There are plenty on the market, however here are a few of my recommendations:

1) Microsoft's Visual Studio Code:

###jQuery vs AngularJS

We will go over the major difference between the two through the remaining videos as you learn how to use AngularJS. AngularJS is a very powerful frame work and a simple comparison between AngularJS and jQuery would be that jQuery is a hammer while AngularJS is a bag containing a hammer, a saw, a wrench, a swiss army knife, etc..
